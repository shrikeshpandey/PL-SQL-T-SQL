These are the SQL scripts I have created.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
In order to get a copy of this repository you need to install the following software:
* [GitHub](https://desktop.github.com/) - The version control system used
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) - Text editor

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running.

Installing GitHub
```
Click on the GitHub link above, then click on Download for Windows.
```
```
Once it finishes downloading click to open.
```
```
Once it finishes installing, click on Sing Into GitHub.com and enter your Username and Password an click on Continue.

```
```
On the left side of the window will be display the Repository (Root and subdirectories).
On the bottom right corner there is a symbol (Arrows pointing up and down) click on it, and then click Pull.
